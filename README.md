## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Supabase account (free tier available)

## Quick Start

### Three Essential Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Push migrations to Supabase (requires Supabase login)
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
npx supabase db push

# 3. Run the project
npm run dev
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Supabase client, and other dependencies.

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and add your Supabase credentials:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your Supabase project credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

You can find these values in your Supabase Dashboard under Settings > API.

### 3. Configure Supabase & Run Migrations

#### Option A: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

1. **Login to Supabase:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   ```
   This will open a browser window for authentication.

2. **Link your project:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_REF` with your project reference from the Supabase URL (e.g., `czanrjnbduutomedjqdp`).

3. **Push all migrations:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```
   This will apply all 20 migration files automatically to create the complete database schema.

#### Option B: Manual Migration (Alternative)

If you prefer to run migrations manually:

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Navigate to SQL Editor in your Supabase Dashboard
3. Execute each migration file in sequential order (0001 through 0020)

**Important:** When using the CLI method, migrations are tracked automatically and won't be re-applied.

### 4. Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:5173**
